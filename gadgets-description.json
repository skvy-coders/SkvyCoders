    "extendedDescription": "The Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G flaunts a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. The device has a stylish design and a vegan leather back panel. The device uses an octa-core Dimensity 7020 SoC which handles all the demanding tasks and gaming with ease. The smartphone features a 100MP primary camera which captures excellent photos. However, the device doesn't feature an ultra-wide camera. Additionally, it doesn't have a microSD card slot, a 3.5mm audio jack, and an IP rating for water and dust resistance.
